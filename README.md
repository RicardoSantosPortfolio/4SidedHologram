# 4SidedHologram Project

This project was built for demonstrating how simple it would be to make a holographic display for the Museum of Natural History of the Federal University of Paraná (Universidade Federal do Paraná - UFPR).

To build this project, it was used a camera asset that creates the four holographic views with a self made logo instead of the original one from the museum.

Used Assets:
